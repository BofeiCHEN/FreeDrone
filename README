"FreeDrone" Version 0.5 - Oct/24/2013

DESCRIPTION
-----------
- FreeDrone is suite of tools & libraries used to operate a unmanned surface 
  vehicle (USV). Project is written in C/Objective-C which leverages the open
  source GNUStep Framework

- The goal of the FreeDrone project is to develop core libraries which can be 
  used for operating an USV, which therefore can be used in an drone autopilot
  application and remote control ‘command’ application

- Currently experimental project

CORE
-----
- Main drone framework which encapsulates all drone system/hardware operation.

- All hardware interactions are abstracted through a 'hardware abstraction
  layer' (HAL)
  
- Utilize OOP design

- Currently beta

APP
-----
- Application used to run a drone instance on a raspberry pi computer.
- Currently prototype

COMMAND
-------
- Application used to run a command server on a Apple computer.
- Currently prototype
